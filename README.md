A multiple linear regression model (MLR), implemented using a Machine learning (ML)  approach with the ordinary least squares (OLS) algorithm, was developed to predict the concentration (C) of Ampicillin using three photometric ratio variables: Green/Red (G/R), Blue/Green (B/G), and Blue/Red (B/R). The model was trained using a dedicated training dataset (ampicilin-trainning.xlsx) and subsequently validated on three independent test sets (test-L1, test-L2, and test-L3) to evaluate its generalization capability and robustness. The predictive performance was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2), Mean absolute error (MAE), and Root mean squared error (RMSE).  


Software Requirements: The source code requires the Python interpreter (version 3.x) and the following dependencies, which can be installed via pip install -r requirements.txt: pandas (data handling), numpy (numerical operations), scikit-learn (ML modeling and metrics), matplotlib (visualization), tabulate (terminal output formatting), and openpyxl (Excel file support).
